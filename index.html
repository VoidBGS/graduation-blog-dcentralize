        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hey, here I will describe what I do each day of my internship at d-centralize, the company I managed to get into for the last year of uni.</p>
        <p> A blog is a good way to document my daily struggles as a new developer in a company that is fairly old now. I am lucky enough to have a handbook for almost all processes that occur at d-centralize, which will make my life easier in the beginning.</p>
        <h3>About > d-centralize</h3>
        <p> D-centralize is a company that operates from Strijp-S, Eindhoven. They build SaaS platforms that are made for an international audience. They work with Dutch and international students and focus on software quality and testing. They offer remote internships and challenging projects.</p>
        <p> The founder of the company is Kees van den Broek and the stakeholders are the clients of the company. The company focuses on providing high quality software for their clients. </p>
        <p> A lot of the programmers in the company are former or current Fontys students, so the workflow that they follow is reminiscent of how a very advanced Fontys university project would be built. They follow all steps of the software development process that I am familiar with like automatic testing, continuous integration and deployment, branching strategies and the use of the Agile methodology. Moreover, the software solutions that are designed by the company are decentralized meaning that they are spread into smaller systems that communicate with each other via API.</p>
        <h3>About > My Assignment</h3>
        <p> My assignment would be to implement new features to an already existing software that were planned by the team. The software itself is a website that aims to help annotators, speech, and language therapists by automatically determining which words are pronounced incorrectly. It utilizes AI for word recognition, and it displays the results using the abovementioned website. The AI in the software makes use of the expertise provided by speech therapists to learn which words are pronounced incorrectly.</p>
        <p> I will work on rethinking and restructuring the architectural decisions. Since the application works with humans there is also the aspect of false positives and negatives, so I need to work with the team to minimize those outcomes by creating a hypothesis, testing it, and evaluating the results. Since d-centralize already has an A.I model that it is trying to improve by restructuring the architectural decisions we can also say that one of the goals of this internship would be to improve the accuracy of that model. The technology stack that will be used in this assignment will be Python for the backend server and ReactJS (Typescript) for the client application. I may also make use of Gitlabs CI/CD pipeline feature for testing and automation.</p>
        <p> I believe that this project would be challenging, but suitable for me as it involves the whole process from development to deployment. It includes developing the full stack application with both Python and React (Typescript), the creation of multiple automated tests and the creation of a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment. I will gain experience in all those fields, and it will help me improve as a programmer. I believe that I can manage to complete this project and I will gain a lot from it as it is challenging, because of the multiple technologies and techniques involved. Another reason why I think this graduation would be suitable for me is that I will also gain experience by working with other, more experienced programmers and communicating with them daily.</p>

        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <h3>06.02.2023 | My first day in the company</h3>
        <p>My first day in the company went smooth. I received my company email, I used the email to log into all my newly created accounts and I gained access to the GitLab repository of the project that I will work on. I made some tasks for the day and I explored the annotator tool. I started by fixing some typos in the Readme.md file. This very simple step enabled me to learn the process of how the branching process is done in the company and how different issues are handled. After fixing some of the typos I went ahead to run the annotator tool locally.</p>
        <h3>07.02.2023 | First issue encountered</h3>
        <p>Today was marked with some issues related to one of the pages that exist inside the annotator tool frontend, which is built in ReactJS, using a combination of TypeScript and JavaScript. I was told that the initial project was created in JavaScript and afterwards they decided to move to TypeScript slowly, but I guess this process is not completed yet. Nevertheless I found an issue with one of the pages that caused the server to be flooded. The issue came when all organizations were loaded into the page, and instead of fetching the recording counts from the server, it instead just submits a request for each organization, in order to fetch the recordings. This is bad. It is a very inefficient way of fetching the counts, because let's say we have 2000 organizations and we have to fetch the counts for all of them. This means that we have to submit 2000 requests, if we are to distribute this system the server can get flooded simply by people visiting this page. I communicated this with my mentor and we decided that it is better to have pagination for the page and see if that fixes some of the slowness caused by that many requests to the server.</p>
        <h3>08.02.2023 | Pagination implementation start</h3>
        <p>I started by running the annotator tool locally and seeing what is the best way to implement pagination in the backend. The annotator tool is comprised of a frontend that is made in ReactJS, a backend that is created with a Python framework named Flask. The data is stored in a totally different project called its-api, which acts as the api, duh, of the system. It is a REST API that follows the OpenAPI specification of building APIs. Even though I read the specification there was not a section that clearly explained pagination. I tried running its-api locally, but I couldn't, even though I followed the Readme file, which conatined the step-by-step guide to run the its-api project. I decided to leave it for tomorrow.</p>
        <h3>09.02.2023 | Issues with the implementation</h3>
        <p>Nothing worked while trying to run the api project. I got tired after a bit and I decided to start implementing a mock pagination for the local backend and the frontend. I did that so I could waste little time when the actual implementation starts (I knew that frontend tasks take me more time). I started by implementing it in the local backend. I created a function called pagination and added some parameters - page and per_page. The page paramenter serves as the number of the page the user is currently on and the per_page parameter refers to the amount of items that are shown, in this case we had 5, 10 ,15, 20, 25 and 30 items that could be shown per page. I also implemented some functionts that validated the user input. I implemented this in the backend and started working on the frontend. The way pagination worked in the frontend was weird, it was client side pagination made by past students. I decided to use their pagination and table components to use it in the problematic page. I tinkered the components and made them so they worked exactly as intended. This "mock" implementation took me until the end of the week to finalize.</p>
        <h3>13.02.2023 | Running its-api locally</h3>
        <p>During the daily standup meeting at 10:00 I asked for some assitance in running the its-api project locally. One of the project maintainers - Redmar, helped me with setting up the environment to run the project. I was missing the <b>git lfs</b> extension from my repository and it was needed to download the larger files. I was also missing an access token, neither of those things were mentione in the step-by-step guide. After receiving the token I tried running the project, but again I was unable to run it locally. At this point Redmar did not know what to do so I decided to let him be and try to run it myself, now that I had all the necessary things in place. My intuition told me that the most obvious reason for me not being able to run the project locally, was that I was using Docker Desktop, instead of the normal Docker engine. I had read that Docker Desktop caused some problems when running some projects because of some privilage issues. For the sake of time I was not interested in handling privilage issues in the Docker Desktop application, so I just deleted it and installed Docker engine. After doing that I went back to the handbook and I read about the process of installing docker engine locally and so I followed it and tried again. This time it worked and I managed to run the project. I was very happy about it and I could finally start applying pagination for the server.</p>
        <h3>14.02.2023 | Server implementation</h3>
        <p>After finally running the project locally I went into the its-api code and started the implementation of the pagination there. It made use of <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> flask version, which already has everything needed to paginate the results that are in the database. I made use of the Pagination object, which already had all the details that I needed to return to the client. I changed the path to accept query URL parameters and extracted the page and per_page parameters out of the url link. After extracting those parameters I used them to query the data in the database and return the paginated object. I had a problem with this though, as I could not return a response different from 200 for some reason.</p>
        <h3>15.02.2023 | Success!</h3>
        <p>While I was looking into the issue with the return not working correctly I noticed that I had a file related to the openAPI specification called api-internal.yaml which contained a JSON object with the return value of the get_all function for organizations. I saw that the return value was an object. I changed it to a Dictionary and returned all the necessary details for the paginated object and all the details needed for the frontend to work correctly. After this file was changed I also added a description to all parameters that are received in the URL query string. This marked the feature as complete and now what was left was to write some unit tests and test the functionality.</p>
        <h3>16.02.2023 | Automated testing for pagination</h3>
        <p>It is my birthday! I ran the project locally again and this time I ran the automated pytest tests. I scrolled down to the organization tests and added a few more to them. I added a tests where you fetch a certain page in the api and one more tests that fetches a certain number of organizations in a certain page. This ensured that the pagination for organizations is well tested and functional. I pushed everything to the Issue I created in GitLab and I set Redmar as the reviewer</p>
        <h3>20.02.2023 | yarn to npm</h3>
        <p>This week started with a Daily meeting in which I explained how the new pagination for organizations worked. Turns out my implementation fixed another problem related to the end-to-end tests not working correctly. After pagination was implemented they started working again. After I communicated this with the team I moved on to another issue that the company wanted me to check out. This issues is in the annotator tool again and it is moving from yarn to npm (again). I started this by creating a new branch called <b>yarn-to-npm</b>. I started by taking a look at the <b>package.json</b> file, where all the commands and packages were stored. I change the commands to npm and removed yarn from it. Afterwards, I ran the command <b>npm install</b> to install all needed packages and removed the <b>yarn.lock</b> file. The install command ran successfully and I moved on to test the application. Everything built correctly, but I noticed an issue with the security threats that npm found. I ran the <b>npm audit</b> command and saw that there were a total of 60+ security threats in the application.</p>
        <h3>21.02.2023 | Package update galore</h3>
        <p>I started the day off with a lot of package updates. I managed to break the application a couple of times and I had to rewrite the <b>package.json</b> file multiple times. I ran another command that tested the application better - <b>npm audit --omit=dev</b> this command did not take into account the packages that were used only in the development environment. I saw that we still had an issue with 3 high level security threats that existed in the production environment. I updated a total of 8 packages to more current versions and tested if the security threats still existed, but thankfully everything was working correctly. I pushed to the repository and saw that I missed some yarn commands in the configurations file, which I promptly fixed. After this I pushed the initial stages of the CI/CD pipeline passed, which were testing and linting. But e2e tests failed, because of missing artifacts. I messaged Nikita, a member of the company that works in developing the annotator tool, and asked him if he knew about this issue. He informed me that he could speak after the sprint delivery is complete. At the end of every two weeks we hold a meeting, in which everyone shares what they completed during the 2 week sprint. I also participated in that meeting and after the meeting was done I held the meeting with Nikita.</p>
        <h3>23.02.2023 | Finishing touches</h3>
        <p>After waiting a bit for Nikita to fix the problem I encountered, I decided that it would be best if I take care of it. I took a look in the pipeline and saw that one of the lines there was incorrect <b>npm run cypress run</b> I tested this in my local environment and it did not run, so I tried with <b>npx</b>, which is made for this. I changed the command to <b>npm cypress run</b> and this successfully ran the e2e tests locally. I changed the pipeline to include this command and the tests passed! This marked the move from yarn to npm as complete. All I had to do now is update the documentation and change all instances of yarn to npm. I pushed my changes and tagged Nikita as my reviewer.</p>
        <h3>24.02.2023 | Handbook problems</h3>
        <p>Today Kees tagged me in a couple of issues that he found in the handbook. He had applied a new linter to the handbook files and there were around 40 linting errors that needed fixing. Since I was in my warmup month he wanted me to fix them. I started by cloning the handbook repository locally and running the new branch he had created with the linter. I ran the command that shows me all the incorrect files. I saw that there were multiple files with missing or unused links in them so I decided to go file by file. Some of the files were false positives, and there weren't any actual errors, more like warnings. I disabled the linting tool warnings, after making sure that they were all the same. I was still left with some files that had missing links, so I had to go file by file and I added the urls for reach link. I made sure that everything was set for the push. After I made sure to test locally I pushed the updated versions of all the fixed files, but I got an error associated with a cpp file, which did not exist in my local machine, but I guess it existed on the pipeline. This prompted me to read the linter's documentation again and I saw that there was a config that could be used to ignore certain file types, I used that and everything was set. I pushed my changes and assigned Kees as reviewer, he accepted them and the new version of the handbook was submitted.</p>
        <h3>27.02.2023 | Linting!</h3>
        <p>When the move from yarn to npm was completed I moved on to another task that I had from this month and this was applying some more backend linters to the project pipeline. I chose one additional linter called <b>pylint</b> which rates the code from a scale of 0 to 10 if it fits the linting standards. We were fortunate enough to hit a 10 out of 10 on the first run. After I added this linter I also updated the confugiation so that it did not include migration files. I added this to the pipeline and submitted the fix for the issue. I am still awaiting review on this.</p>
